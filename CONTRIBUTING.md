### 3. Code Contributions

#### Pull Request Process
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Make** your changes with proper tests
4. **Test** thoroughly: `cargo test`
5. **Commit** with descriptive messages
6. **Push** to your fork: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
7. **Open** a Pull Request

#### Code Standards
- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Use `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Run `cargo clippy` for linting
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Document public APIs with rustdoc

#### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of changes if needed.

Fixes #issue-number
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Test all public functions
- Use property-based testing for cryptographic functions
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows
- Verify cross-component interactions
- Include performance benchmarks

### Example Test Structure
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_did_creation() {
        // Arrange
        let method = "example";
        
        // Act
        let (did_doc, _) = create_basic_did_document(method, KeyType::Ed25519).unwrap();
        
        // Assert
        assert!(did_doc.id.starts_with("did:example:"));
        assert!(did_doc.validate().is_ok());
    }
}
```

## üìö Documentation
